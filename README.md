# ALLY_Nobara_fixes
Compilation of fixes for the ROG ALLY when using Nobara

More detailed instructions coming soon (if necessary), but this is primarily to share with Nobara maintainers at first.

I highly recommend using this [repo's utility](https://github.com/Maclay74/steam-patch) so that the side buttons function like they would on the Steam Deck in a `gamescope-session` or big picture mode in desktop view.

In time, this repo will likely become obsolete once all fixes are absorbed into later Linux kernel versions by default.
